# Ardoq Pre-interview Technical tasks

## Task 1

**Create a function that, given a list of integers, returns the highest product between three of those numbers. For example, given the list [1, 10, 2, 6, 5, 3] the highest product would be 10 * 6 * 5 = 300**

I used a Python script for this task, as Python is well suited for simple calculations like this. It is also a language I personally know quite well.

## Task 2

**Oslo city bikes has an open API showing real-time data on location and state of the bike stations.
Your task is to create a small application that utilizes this api to show the stations and the amount of available bikes and free spots a station currently has. Youâ€™re free to choose which language and libraries you use. How you show the stations and status is also up to you.**

Here I used vanilla Javascript and the Fetch API to retrieve and display the live data on a web page. The status automatically refreshes every 10 seconds, which is the same refresh rate as the API itself has.
